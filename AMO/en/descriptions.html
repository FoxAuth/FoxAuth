Disclaimers
During sync, you are <strong>NOT</strong> supposed to do any of the listed behaviors or you are totally responsible for your data loss:
<ol type="1">
<li>Moving, renaming, deleting or manually editting any file in our app folder (copying and pasting shall not cause issues though).</li>

<li>use different encryption passwords among different devices.</li>
</ol>

You shall also note that if you connect a Firefox with encrypted FoxAuth database, all unecrypted Firefox FoxAuth databases will be override.

Revisioning
Here is how this project gets revisioning:
<ul>
<li>a - major changes, represents a complete overhaul of the code in the file, hardly distinguishable from before; you probably will never need to bump this; when creating new files just give it a version of 1.0.0.</li>
<li>b - mid-level changes, when you add or modify a significant chunk of code that alters the way the rest works; for instance when adding whole new features.</li>
<li>c - minor changes, such as most bugfixes; this is probably what you will be bumping most often.</li>
</ul>

Security
We use encryption code from <a href="github.com/mozilla/send">Firefox Send</a> in WebCrypto API. Welcome as we are to any security review, it shall be more efficiently to perform it at that side.
