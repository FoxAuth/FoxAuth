## Disclaimers

During sync, you are **NOT** supposed to do any of the listed behaviors or you are totally responsible for your data loss:

1. Moving, renaming, deleting or manually editting any file in our app folder (copying and pasting shall not cause issues though).
1. operate account info between several devices in a **REALLY** frequent rate.
1. use different encryption passwords among different devices.

You shall also note that if you connect a Firefox with encrypted FoxAuth database, all unecrypted Firefox FoxAuth databases will be override.

## Revisioning

Here is how this project gets revisioning:

- a - major changes, represents a complete overhaul of the code in the file, hardly distinguishable from before; you probably will never need to bump this; when creating new files just give it a version of 1.0.0. 

- b - mid-level changes, when you add or modify a significant chunk of code that alters the way the rest works; for instance when adding whole new features.

- c - minor changes, such as most bugfixes; this is probably what you will be bumping most often.

## Security

We use encryption code from [Firefox Send](github.com/mozilla/send) in WebCrypto API. Welcome as we are to any security review, it shall be more efficiently to perform it at that side.
